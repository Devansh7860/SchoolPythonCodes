# READING METHODS---------

#txt = myfile.read()  #reads all the characters in the file.. if any no. is mentioned as argument .. then it reads that many no. of characters
#txt1 = myfile.readline() #reads a single line at a time... this will read first line
#txt2 = myfile.readline() #this will read second line
#txt3 = myfile.readlines() #reads all lines and store them in a list
myfile.close()
#never use these 3 methods together.. it won't work properly.. use any one at a time
